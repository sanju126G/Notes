1. What is node js ?.
    -> node js is a open source, cross-paltform, run time environment that runs on V8 engine and excutes javascript outside web browsers.
    ->  Node.js can be used to build different types of applications such as command line application, 
         web application, real-time chat application, REST API server etc. However, it is mainly used to build 
         network programs like web servers, similar to PHP, Java, or ASP.NET.
    -> Node.js was written and introduced by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
    -> Node has Implemented the Global Object along with Original Java Script Code.

2. What are the advantages of node js ?.
    -> It is a Open Source.
    -> Since node js follows single threaded event loop architecture, we can biuld fast and scalable applications.
    -> And also Helps in building cross-platform applications.
    -> Asynchronous by default. So it performs faster than other frameworks.

3. Disadvantage of node js ?.
    -> Reduces performance when handling heavy computational tasks.
    -> Because node js follows Asynchronous programming approach, it relies alot on callbacks, 
        this directly impacts the performance.
    -> this makes code tedious to understand and maintain the code.

4. node js Roles ?.
    1. Run Server
        -> Node.js can create a server and listen to incoming requests.
    2. Business Logic
        -> Handle requests.
        -> Validate input.
        -> Connect to database.
    3. Responses
        -> Return Responses(HTML pages, JSON…)

5. Execution of Node JS Code
    -> Node JS Code can be Executed in Two Ways
        1. Using REPL
            REPL REP :- way of executing can be used for practicing purpose , note for storing, Code we have written 
            Is just for temporary
                R - > Reading Input
                E - > Executing Input 
                P - > Printing 
                L - > Loping for Next Input
        2 . Using Files
            Creating JavaScript File and writing the Code and Executing.

6. GLobals in node js ?.
    -> Node.js global objects are global in nature and they are available in all modules.
    -> These objects are modules,functions, strings and object itself as below.
        -> __filename
        -> __dirname
        -> setTimeout()
        -> setInterval()
        -> clearTimeout()
        -> clearInterval()
        -> Module
        -> Console
        -> Process

7. What are Module system in node js ?.
    -> In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.
    -> Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
    -> node js supports three types of modules.

        1. Core Modules :- 
            -> Core Modules are the Modules Provided by the Node JS itself but Module is not available in 
              script File until we import the Module.
            -> Examples : fs Module , os Module, path Module, url Module, http Module, Buffer Module.
      
        2. Third Party Modules :- 
            -> Third Party Modules are the Modules provided by the node package manager.
            -> How to Use the Third party Module :
                1. npm install module-name
                2. const preferedName = require(“module-name”);
        
        3. Local Module :- 
            -> Local Module is defined as the Module created by us and used in other script Files to add the 
               extra features.

8. File Systems (fs):-
    -> The fs module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.
    -> There is no need to install it. Being part of the Node.js core, it can be used by simply requiring it as below:
         const fs = require('fs')
    -> Once you do so, you have access to all its methods, which include:
        1. fs.access(): check if the file exists and Node.js can access it with its permissions
