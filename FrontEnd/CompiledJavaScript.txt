1. What is JavaScript?
	-> JavaScript is a Light-Weight, interpreted, Object-Oriented, Cross-platform and dynamic type Scripting Language.

		1. Lightweight programming language are those which have following features:-

			a. Syntax and features uses the least hardware and software resources possible.
			b. Use very less memory to execute.
			c. Easily portable/Less size.

	 	2. InterPreter:-
			
			-> The interpreter converts the source code line-by-line during RUN Time.
			-> Interpreter allows evaluation and modification of the program while it is executing.
			-> Hence, Relatively less time spent for analyzing and processing the program.

		3.Compiler:- 
			-> A compiler is a computer program that transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code. 

		4. Diffrence Between Compiler And interpreter.

			-> We need to convert the source code into machine code and this is accomplished by compilers and interpreters.
			-> Hence, a compiler or an interpreter is a program that converts program written in high-level language into machine code understood by the computer.
			
			-> Compiler transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code, at once, before program runs.
			-> whereas an Interpreter coverts each high-level program statement, one by one, into the machine code, during program run.

			-> Compiled code runs faster while interpreted code runs slower.
			-> Compiler displays all errors after compilation, on the other hand, the Interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.
			-> Compiler is based on translation linking-loading model, whereas Interpreter is based on Interpretation Method.
		
			-> Linking and Loading are the utility programs that play a important role in the execution of a program. 
				-> Linking intakes the object codes generated by the assembler and combines them to generate the executable module. 
				-> On the other hand, the loading loads this executable module to the main memory for execution.

		5.Object-Oriented:-

			-> Object-oriented programming can be defined to be:

				-> a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

			-> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. 
			-> Almost everything in JavaScript is an object. 
			-> You can also implement the main concepts of object-oriented programming which are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism using JavaScript. 
			-> Therefore, JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language.
		6. Static Vs Dynamic Typing.
			
			-> Static Typing means when you create a variable you need to tell the computer what kind of data will be stored in it (Text, Numeric, something else...) and you can't change it after the fact.
			-> Dynamic Typing means you don't need to tell the computer what kind of data will be stored in a variable when you create it. The types are checked as the program runs (at "runtime").

2. Features of javaScript?
	-> JavaScript is case sensitive.
	-> JavaScript is object based language as it provides predefined objects.
		-> for ex:- 1. Date( ) Object.
					2. Math	object.
	-> And also Predefined methods.
	-> JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
